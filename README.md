### Nordalbanische Begegnungen
**by Henrik Krenaraj**

Written from the perspective of an outsider, this collection seeks to explore the profound 
depths of *Nderi (Honor)*, *Respekt (Respect)*, and *Besa (The Word of Honor)*. 
It does not shy away from the shadows that exist in Northern Albania, as they do in any society. 
Yet, among the rugged mountains, I encountered numerous individuals of such rare integrity and 
selfless generosity that they became my personal role models.

These stories are a humble attempt to capture that spirit - a glimpse into a world where, 
for the best among them, a promise weighs more than life itself. While narrative details have been 
adapted for these pages, the core of every story is true-rooted in actual events experienced either 
by myself or by those closest to me.

Perhaps these encounters are more than just memories; they are a gentle reminder that integrity and a 
clear moral compass are not geographical traits, but human necessities — virtues that Western Europe, 
amidst its complexity, would do well to rediscover.
